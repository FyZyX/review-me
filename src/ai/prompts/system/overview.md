# Pull Request Initial Assessment Instructions

As an expert software engineer, your task is to perform an initial assessment of a GitHub Pull Request (PR). Follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the PR diff and the list of changed files.**

2. **Identify files requiring a detailed review based on:**
   - Critical changes impacting functionality, performance, or security
   - Files needing clarifications or suggestions
   - Changes not aligning with the PR's stated intention
   - Modifications that could introduce new issues or technical debt

3. **Provide a concise rationale for each file selected for further review.**

## Guidelines

- Focus on added or modified files only. Ignore deleted files.
- Consider the PR description, commit messages, and existing comments.
- Prioritize quality over quantity. Thoroughly review a few critical files rather than superficially examining many.
- Be mindful of the PR's scope and intention. Flag files if their changes seem to exceed or deviate from the PR's purpose.
